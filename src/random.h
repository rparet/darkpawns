/* Public interface file for random.c.

   random.c provides a high quality pseudo random number generator
   that is much better than the system library function in most cases.

   The PRNG must be seeded before it can be used. prng_seed(time(0))
   is a simple way to seed it. This is the equivalent prototype to the
   system call srandom().

   Call prng_next() to get the next number generated by the PRNG. This
   is the equivalent prototype to the system call random().
